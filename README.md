- Please replace in `FrameBufferSerialPortLib.c` DELAY variable value with your own prefered value in microseconds
Default value is 0.2s

`UINTN delay = 200000; // 0.2s`
<br> Below are few examples how to set the delay value
```
1000000 = 1s <br>
 500000 = 0.5s <br>
 100000 = 0.1s <br>

```


I hope that will help in your future projects<br><br>
Have fun!
